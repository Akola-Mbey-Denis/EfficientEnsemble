# How to effectively train an ensemble of Faster R-CNN object detectors to quantify uncertainty
PyTorch implementation for How to effectively train an ensemble of Faster R-CNN object detectors to quantify uncertainty
## Abstract
In this work, we provide a competitive and efficient Deep Ensemble method for quantifying uncertainity in Faster R-CNN Object detectors. 

Overview :
EfficentEnsemble requires only one RPN network and multiple Faster R-CNN prediction heads which is lightweight and less computationally expensive to quantify uncertainity.

## Experiment

### We perform experiments on Three datasets : MOT16, KITTI,BDD100K

### Monocular depth estimation example
In folder `monocular_depth_estimation/`, we provide the codes and instructions for LDU applying on monocular depth estimation task. The detailed information is shown on `monocular_depth_estimation/README.md`.
