# How to effectively train an ensemble of Faster R-CNN object detectors to quantify uncertainty
PyTorch implementation for How to effectively train an ensemble of Faster R-CNN object detectors to quantify uncertainty
## Abstract
In this work, we provide a competitive and efficient Deep Ensemble method for quantifying uncertainity in Faster R-CNN Object detectors. 

Overview :
EfficentEnsemble requires only one RPN network and multiple Faster R-CNN prediction heads which is lightweight and less computationally expensive to quantify uncertainity.
